simutil
=======

Scripts and small utilitary programs to assist in simulations (using DL-POLY, GROMACS or Towhee). The utilitaries are based on a specific program's output or input files.
Every tool is designed to work with as little as possible of input. Idealy the programs run without the need to provide any input, the tool runs taking what it need from the folder in which it is called.
